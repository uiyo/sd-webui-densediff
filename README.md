# sd-webui-densediff
densediffusion extension on stable-diffusion-webui

This extension is based on:

ICCV 2023 paper [**Dense Text-to-Image Generation with Attention Modulation**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12964.pdf) and its diffusers project [**DenseDiffusion**](https://github.com/naver-ai/DenseDiffusion) 

Merely support SD v1.5, no bug for SDXL, but not work :<

Use this extension together with ControlNet will be very fun :>
